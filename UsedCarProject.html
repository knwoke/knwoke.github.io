									<h1>CARS.COM Used Car Analysis<br/>
									</h1>
									<p>The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to an increase in used car prices due in part to supplier shortages and increased consumer demand. I recently helped a friend in the market for a used car and observed that the prices were still elevated from pre-COVID levels. Curious I began analyzing how different used car characteristics influence the cost and availability of used cars.</p>

								<h3>Extracting Car Listing Data</h3>
								<p>I selected CARS.com as my data source for this analysis since it is the second largest automotive classified site and has a diverse population to draw from. This would allow for a large enough sample size to derive statistically relavant insights. The cars included in the analysis are local to the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex. Given the broad scope of the analysis, I did not apply additional filters to the CARS.com search results. To generate the dataset I created a web scraper in Python using BeautifulSoup and Requests to extract current car listings from 12/5/2022 through 12/7/2022. I throttled the scraping to reduce the stress on CARS.com's servers and mitigate the prospect of my IP address becoming blocked. The scraper is available <a href="https://github.com/knwoke/Used-Car-Analysis/blob/main/CarListing.py">here</a></p>
								<h3>Transforming Car Listing Data</h3> 	
								<p>The returned results contained extraneous HTML tags I removed in Excel. After the HTML tags were removed, I also used Excel to remove rows which contained Null or duplicated (based on a combination of car name, mileage, and price) data. I also standardized capitalization across the dataset. Once the data was cleaned I created a new 'Year' column which is derived from the scraped 'Title' column which already included the model year and created new categorical variables based on different ranges of prices and mileages. I loaded the finalized dataset into an Excel worksheet for analysis.</p>
